## Project thoughts

I'm interested in exploring data related to Rotten Tomatoes Movie Reviews. By looking at the number rating, positive or negative language used, and "validity" of critic, I want to see how these variables influence people's decisions to watch that movie. I would measure this through ticket sales or number of viewers.
